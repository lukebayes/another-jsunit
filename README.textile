h1. Simple JSUnit

This is a simple unit test framework that is built on the idea that unit testing should not be difficult.

I checked out the other "JSUnit":http://jsunit.net/ and after about 30 minutes of digging around, couldn't really figure out where to start. 

This is likely a problem with my own comprehension more than a problem with their implementation, so please only use this if you have also checked out the real JSUnit!

This framework supports testing simple, synchronous features, asynchronous features and even visual components.

The test framework itself is decoupled from any particular JavaScript framework, but I have only created a ResultPrinter for JQuery output. If you're using a different JS framework, you should check out the <code>jquery-printer.js</code> and <code>jquery-printer.css</code> files for examples of how you might implement what you need.

This framework was developed over a weekend while working on a Rails application. I'm essentially sharing it because I think code should be shared. 

If you want changes made, fork, change it and send me a pull request. I'm not planning on creating a community around this tool because smart people seem to be satisfied with the existing JUnit.

h1. Simple JSUnit

This is a simple unit test framework that is built on the idea that unit testing should not be difficult or challenging.

I checked out the other JSUnit and after about 20 minutes of messing around, couldn't really figure out where to start. This is likely a problem with my own comprehension more than a problem with their implementation, so please only use this if you have also checked out JSUnit and found it missing something you need!
